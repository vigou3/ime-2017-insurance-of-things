## Abstract

Imagine insuring not only the home of a philatelist for a nominal
amount, but each individual stamp in her collection at its current
market value. Until recently, this was economically feasible for very
large or high profile collections only. 

The Internet of Things brought us interconnected physical devices
(from smoke detectors and door looks, to cars and whole buildings)
collecting and exchanging data over a network, usually the Internet.
For the insurance industry, this digital technology induces what we
will refer to as the Insurance of Things: very finely grained coverage
for a body of objects monitored constantly one way or another. 

We review some challenges actuaries face when pricing such insurance
policies, notably the lack of prior data, varying effects from the
different causes of peril and inherent dependence between the insured
goods. We also present how we tackled these problems in an actual
application.
