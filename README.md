A foray into the insurance of things, or how to price individual objects without prior data

Imagine insuring not only the home of a philatelist for a nominal amount, but each individual stamp in her collection at its current market value. Until recently, this was economically feasible for very large or high profile collections only. The Internet of Things brought us interconnected physical devices (from smoke detectors and door looks, to cars and whole buildings) collecting and exchanging data over a network, usually the Internet. For the insurance industry, this digital technology induces what we will refer to as the Insurance of Things: very finely grained coverage for a body of objects monitored constantly one way or another. In this talk, we will review some challenges actuaries will face when pricing such insurance policies, notably the lack of prior data, varying effects from the different causes of peril and inherent dependence between the insured goods. We will also present how we tackled these problems in an actual application.
